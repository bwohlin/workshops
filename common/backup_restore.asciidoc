== Backup and Restore Your Database 

We don't have time to cover this in class today but I want to give you instructions so you can do this at home if you want.  Ths touches on an area that we didn't have time to dig in on - permanent storage. We used it in our postgresql data but we are not using it with the metrics. 

To backup we are going to write and read from disc. So you are going to have to trust me and just follow along unless you finish early.
