== Installing the Vagrant Box

Let's go ahead and install the Vagrant box file and get everything up and running. 


=== Hardware Requirements
1. 10 gigs of disk to start but may need up to 40
2. At least 8 gigs of RAM by default. Our VM will use 4 by default so we want to leave 4 gigs for the OS and others


=== Software Requirements
1. Install VirtualBox
2. Install Vagrant
